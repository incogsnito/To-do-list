This is a simple to-do list. 
As I am focusing on volume, I am not dedicating too much time to this project, it's just something to keep the ball rolling.
I am mass producing projects, to cement concepts faster, they do all come with learning experiences. 

The goal of this was to stretch my knowledge and put it into action.

It took roughly 4-6 hours(Was so fun, I didn't keep track.)to complete this.

I have not learned about local storages, so the to-do list will reset upon refresh.

This is a simple to-do list. Any suggestions on improvements to code structure and accessability are welcome.
